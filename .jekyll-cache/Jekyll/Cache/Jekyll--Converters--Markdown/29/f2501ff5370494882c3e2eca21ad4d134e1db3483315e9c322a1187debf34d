I'm a third year computer science student at the University of Edinburgh. I'm trying to get better at software development as everything I've made so far is just mashed together python scripts. I thought having a website that looks **exactly** like every other software developers website was a good start.

You can follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/Evan-Moss). It's a right mess, there's not much there - I'm still learning how it all works really. Don't judge my poor practice!

I also tweet nonsense at [@ev\_jo\_mo](https://twitter.com/ev_jo_mo).

This website is made with the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) theme by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). It uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is hosted through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). Biggest thanks to [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) for the design.
