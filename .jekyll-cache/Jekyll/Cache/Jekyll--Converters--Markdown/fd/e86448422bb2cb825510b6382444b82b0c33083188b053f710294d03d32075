<p>I’m a third year computer science student at the University of Edinburgh. I’m trying to get better at software development as everything I’ve made so far is just mashed together python scripts. I thought having a website that looks <strong>exactly</strong> like every other software developers website was a good start.</p>

<p>You can follow me on <a href="https://github.com/Evan-Moss">GitHub</a>. It’s a right mess, there’s not much there - I’m still learning how it all works really. Don’t judge my poor practice!</p>

<p>I also tweet nonsense at <a href="https://twitter.com/ev_jo_mo">@ev_jo_mo</a>.</p>
