I"À<p>Iâ€™m a third year computer science student at the University of Edinburgh. Iâ€™m trying to get better at formal software development as everything Iâ€™ve made so far is just mashed together python scripts. I thought having a website that looks exactly like <em>every other software developers website</em> was a good start.</p>
