"Bloody hell Evan, that's an original name for a first post - you are a true visionary." I know, I know, I have made **the most** stereotypical software developer website. I've even linked my GitHub, look (I still don't understand how GitHub works). I've added a little footer with the little *made with love* thing that you see on proper open-source projects too. I don't know about you but I think this is a major step in me becoming a software developer. I might start wearing hoodies and stop speaking to people.

Like most people I have started a blog with good intentions. Also like most people, this blog probably won't last - I wouldn't be surprised if this is the last thing I post here to be honest. That's a bad look isn't it? Anyway, I'm just happy it exists. I've had this domain for almost all of my life, due to a savvy purchase by my Dad in the early days of the world wide web, and now there is finally something on it. If I do post anything here, it will probably be about some useless project that I'm working on (I have to keep the stereotype going) or just about anything that I think is a bit interesting. It's all a bit of fun, and no-one is going to read any of it anyway so who cares?

I suppose the most recent thing I've worked on is this website here. I had a blast getting it all to work, nicking a [theme](https://github.com/poole/hyde) and making it my own, failing to use git properly again and just editing the code directly on GitHub. A blast! Anyway, that's it for this boring introduction, I hope you've had a great time. If my earlier prediction is right this could be the last thing posted on this site - a bit of jeopardy for you.
